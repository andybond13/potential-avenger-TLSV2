#test6 about.txt

This test tests the displacement result of the problem of a one-dimensional bar with no initial damage. A pair of elements in the middle is weakened slightly, and nucleation should occur there, making a few damage segment, eventually forming a hat. 100 elements, TS refinement = 10.
