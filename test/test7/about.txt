#test7 about.txt

This test tests the displacement result of the problem of a one-dimensional bar with no initial damage. Like test5, an element on the left edge is weakened, allowing nucleation to occur there. Later, nucleation occurs at the other edge due to the stress wave reflection. 100 elements.
