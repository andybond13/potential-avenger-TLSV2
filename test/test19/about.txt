This test tests the displacement result of the problem of a one-dimensional bar with no initial damage, but with a sinusoidally-varying strength (amplitude = 0.25Yc, 6 weak spots). Damage is nucleated at the weak spots and evolves, fully fracturing the bar. Element death is incorporated. Non-local only.
